<p>This presentation is based on joint research with Julie Hunter and Nicholas Asher.</p>

<p>While linguists and philosophers have sought to model the various ways
in which the meaning of what we say can depend on the nonlinguistic
context, this work has by and large focused on how the nonlinguistic
context can be exploited to ground or anchor referential or otherwise
context-sensitive expressions. In this talk, I'll focus on examples in
which nonlinguistic events contribute entire discourse units that
serve as arguments to coherence relations, without the mediation of
context-sensitive expressions.  I'll use both naturally occurring and
constructed examples to highlight these interactions and to argue that
extant coherence-based accounts of discourse should be extended to
model them.  I'll also argue that extending coherence-based accounts in
this way is a nontrivial task. It forces us to reassess basic notions
of the nonlinguistic context and rhetorical relations as well as
models of discourse structure, evolution and interpretation.</p>

    <div class="tmain"><b>Matthew Stone:</b> Explicit Indirection
    <div class="tsecond">
<p>This presentation is based on joint research with Ernie Lepore.</p>

<p>I contest the traditional view of indirection in utterances such as, ‘Can you pass the salt?’ by developing a very different way of characterizing the interpretations involved: on its usual interpretation, I argue, an utterance of (1) first raises the question whether the addressee can pass the salt and second expresses a preference, in the case that the answer is ‘yes’, that the addressee do so. This move feels indirect, I suggest, because of the weak commitment it imposes on the speaker and the flexible responses it affords the addressee. So understood, there is no presumption that indirect meanings involve the pragmatic derivation of enriched contents from a literal interpretation; rather, I argue that indirect meanings are explicitly encoded in grammar. I make the idea precise by building on recent work on formalizing declarative, interrogative, and imperative meanings as distinct but compatible kinds of content.</p>
